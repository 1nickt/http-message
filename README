This is LWP version 0.02, a set of perl modules for WWW Access.

In order to use this library you will need Perl version 5.001e or
better.  You will also need to install the standard libraries and the
URI::URL module.  The URI::URL module should be available from the
same place where you got this package.

See lib/LWP.pm for details of the library. See ChangeLog for recent
changes.  POD style documentation is included in all modules and
scripts.  You should be able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract
documentation from these files.

You install the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Installation of the library is really simply to copy LWP.pm and the
LWP directory to your standard perl library location.  You might also
want to install some or all of the programs found in the bin
directory.

The best place to discuss this code is on the <libwww-perl@ics.uci.edu>
mailing list.
