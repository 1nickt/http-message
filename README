README file for libwww-perl version 5b9
---------------------------------------

Libwww-perl is a collection of Perl modules which provides a simple
and consistent programming interface (API) to the World-Wide Web.

There are actually two versions of libwww-perl: one for Perl4, and one
for Perl5. Both have a similar architecture, loosely based on the CERN
Library of Common Code.


The Perl4 version is maintained by Roy Fielding, and was the basis for
tools such as MOMSpider. This version and much more information about
its libraries can be found at:

     http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/websoft/libwww-perl/
      ftp://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/websoft/libwww-perl/


The Perl5 version (this package) is a complete rewrite for Perl5: the
code is organized in Modules, provides an Object Oriented API, is
updated for the latest HTTP and URL specification, and offers some
extended functionality.


AVAILABILITY

The Perl5 version of libwww-perl is currently in beta, and the latest
version should always be available from:

     http://www.sn.no/libwww-perl/

The library is also available from the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network (CPAN). Visit http://www.perl.com/ to find a CPAN site near
