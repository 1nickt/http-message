This is libwww-perl version 5b6, a set of perl modules for WWW Access.

In order to use this library you will need Perl version 5.001e or
better.

See lib/LWP.pm for details of the library. See ChangeLog for recent
changes.  POD style documentation is included in all modules and scripts.
You should be able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract documentation
from these files.


You install the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

You can edit the configuration section of Makefile.PL to select which
programs to install in addition to the library itself.  If you don't
want to install any programs then make the initial Makefile with:

   perl Makefile.PL -l


The best place to discuss this code is on the <libwww-perl@ics.uci.edu>
mailing list.  You can join the mailing list by sending a mail message to
<libwww-perl-request@ics.uci.edu> with "Subscribe" as subject.
