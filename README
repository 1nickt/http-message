This is LWP version 0.01, a set of perl modules for WWW Access.

In order to use this library you will need Perl version 5.001e or
better.  You will also need to install the standard libraries and the
URI::URL module.  The URI::URL module should be available from the
same place where you got this package.

See LWP.pm for details of the library. See ChangeLog for recent
changes.  POD style documentation is included in all modules and
scripts.  You should be able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract
documentation from these files.  You may also find it easy to extract
the documentation by running the "make html" command.

The easiest way to install this library is to run "make install".
Installation of the library is simply to copy LWP.pm and the LWP
directory to your standard perl library location.  You might also want
to install some or all of the programs found in the bin directory.

The best place to discuss this code is on the <libwww-perl@ics.uci.edu>
mailing list.
