This is LWP version 0.01, a set of perl modules for WWW Access.

In order to use this library you will need Perl version 5.001 or
later, and the URI::URL module.  The URI::URL module should be
available from the same place where you got this package.

See LWP.pm for details of the library. See ChangeLog for recent
changes.

You install the library by copying LWP.pm and the LWP directory to
your standard perl library location.  You might also want to install
some or all of the programs found in the bin directory.  The easiest
way to install this library is to run "make install".

The best place to discuss this code is on the <libwww-perl@ics.uci.edu>
mailing list.
