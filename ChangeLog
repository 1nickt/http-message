Fri Jul 14 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Reorganized directories.  Moved LWP.pm up.  Moved file.pm and http.pm
    into the LWP::Protocol direcotory.  Moved LWP out of the lib directory
    and removed lib.

 o  Implemented the "get" and "mirror" scripts in the "bin" directory.

 o  Implemented "install-lwp", "update_version" and "make-dist".  The library
    version number is found in the VERSION file.

 o  Always adds 1900 to the year in LWP::Date

 o  In LWP::MIMEheader:  Implemented clone(), removeHeader() and scan() 
    methods.  Reimplemented asString.  Removed asMIME().  Moved "Good
    Practice" into this file, and reimplemented it.

 o  Moved "header" and "content" into LWP::Message class.  This change made
    LWP::Request and LWP::Response much simpler.  Made clone() method
    actually work.

 o  LWP::Protocol::implementor does not die if it cannot load package.

 o  Moved UserAgent convenience methods into LWP::Simple.  Made LWP::Simple
    export LWP::StatusCode symbols and functions.

 o  Implemented $ua->isProtocolSupported($scheme) method.

 o  Nicer directory listing in LWP::Protocol::file.pm

 o  Rely on URI::URL 3.00 behaviour for $url->full_path

 o  Library version number now in LWP.pm.  You should be able to say
    "use LWP 1.0;" if you need at least this version.

 o  Various cleanups and arranging layout as I like it.  Use fooBar-style
    (as opposed to foo_bar stype) everywhere.  This means that as_string()
    now is called asString().

 o  Added more documentation.
