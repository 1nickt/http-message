 o  New module URI::Escape (URI::URL use this module for default
    escaping) that provide the uri_escape() and uri_unescape()
    functions.

 o  Setting $url->scheme now changes the class of the object.

 o  Made $httpurl->user() and $httpurl->password() illegal.
    Likewise for other URL schemes.




Wed Aug  9 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Reorganisation as discussed on <libwww-perl@ics.uci.edu>
       LWP::Date       --> HTTP::Date
       LWP::MIMEheader --> HTTP::Headers
       LWP::StatusCode --> HTTP::Status
       LWP::Message    --> HTTP::Message
       LWP::Request    --> HTTP::Request
       LWP::Response   --> HTTP::Response
       LWP::MIMEtypes  --> LWP::MediaTypes

 o  HTTP::Date parses ctime format with missing timezone as suggested
    by Roy Fielding <fielding@beach.w3.org>

 o  HTTP::Status and LWP::MediaTypes exports their functions by default.

 o  Splitted up the URI::URL module.  Schemes are implemented by separate
    files that are autoloaded when used.  Self test moved to "t/uri.t".


       
Mon Aug  7 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Applied patch from Marc Hedlund <hedlund@best.com>
       - Update the @header_order according to the August 3rd draft.
       - Added Response Header fields: 'Location', 'Public', 'Retry-After',
         'Server', and 'WWW-Authenticate'.
       - Moved 'unknown header' handling from &scan to &header. The old
         implementation was forcing all unknown header-words to begin with
	 an uppercase (as it should be), but disallowed other uppercase
	 letters.
       - updates the status code messages under the August
         3rd HTTP/1.0 draft.  '203' became 'Non-Authoritative Information',
	 '303' became 'See Other', and a new code,
	 '411 Authorization Refused', was added.

 o  Can remove multiple headers with single removeHeader() call in MIMEheader.

 o  Can assign multiple field/value pairs in header() method of MIMEheader.

 o  A field with multiple values is printed as separate values in
    MIMEheader::as_string().

 o  LWP::Response contain new attributes: previous() and request().  These
    attributes are updated by the UserAgent.

 o  Appended \n to some die statements in Socket so that line numbers are
    suppressed in error messages.

 o  Made UserAgent::clone work for reference members

 o  Check for redirect loops and multiple authorization failures by
    examination of the response chain.

 o  Use "\015\012" instead of "\r\n" in protocol modules.  Some systems
    define \r and \n differently.

 o  request program can now handle documents that needs autorization by
    prompting the user for username/password. Added new -S option to print
    request/response chain.


  
Tue Jul 25 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Release 0.02

 o  Included URI::URL in the release



Mon Jul 24 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Incorporated Makemake.PL and VERSION from Andreas Koenig <koenig@mind.de>
    As a result of this the following things have changed:
       - programs in "bin" are extracted from .PL-files
       - reintroduced "lib"
       - "test" has been renamed as "t"
       - test programs in "t" has been made Test::Harness compatible
       - we now have a MANIFEST file
       - no more need fro update_version, make-dist, lwp-install

 o  Renamed bin/get to bin/request.  Links to it are now all upper case.

 o  Proxy support in bin/request (provided by Martijn Koster)

 o  UserAgent can now load proxy settings from environment

 o  LWP::Protocol::ftp is under way but not really finished



Tue Jul 18 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Implemented LWP::Protocol::gopher

 o  Implemented LWP::Protocol::mailto

 o  Fixed proxy typo



Mon Jul 17 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Made release 0.01



Mon Jul 17 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Don't loose first line of HTTP/0.9 requests

 o  LWP::Socket use syswrite() for writing

 o  Added RC_* documentation to LWP::StatusCode

 o  LWP::Date now use hash to look up month numbers

 o  Added -f option to "get"

 o  Untabify

 o  Added a "TODO" list

 o  Fixed various typos



Fri Jul 14 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Reorganized directories.  Moved LWP.pm up.  Moved file.pm and http.pm
    into the LWP::Protocol direcotory.  Moved LWP out of the lib directory
    and removed lib.

 o  Implemented the "get" and "mirror" scripts in the "bin" directory.

 o  Implemented "install-lwp", "update_version" and "make-dist".  The library
    version number is found in the VERSION file.

 o  Always adds 1900 to the year in LWP::Date

 o  In LWP::MIMEheader:  Implemented clone(), removeHeader() and scan() 
    methods.  Reimplemented asString.  Removed asMIME().  Moved "Good
    Practice" into this file, and reimplemented it.

 o  Moved "header" and "content" into LWP::Message class.  This change made
    LWP::Request and LWP::Response much simpler.  Made clone() method
    actually work.

 o  LWP::Protocol::implementor does not die if it cannot load package.

 o  Moved UserAgent convenience methods into LWP::Simple.  Made LWP::Simple
    export LWP::StatusCode symbols and functions.

 o  Implemented $ua->isProtocolSupported($scheme) method.

 o  Nicer directory listing in LWP::Protocol::file.pm

 o  Rely on URI::URL 3.00 behaviour for $url->full_path

 o  Library version number now in LWP.pm.  You should be able to say
    "use LWP 1.0;" if you need at least this version.

 o  Various cleanups and arranging layout as I like it.  Use fooBar-style
    (as opposed to foo_bar stype) everywhere.  This means that as_string()
    now is called asString().

 o  Added more documentation.

 o  Minor cleanups from printed code inspection



Wed May 24 1995   Martijn Koster <m.koster@nexor.co.uk>
