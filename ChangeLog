 o  Implemented LWP::RobotUA

 o  Class name for RobotRules did not match the file name

 o  URI::URL
      - perl5.002gamma is required (because use vars).

      - URI::URL::_generic moved out of URL.pm
      - netloc, path, params, query is now stored internally in escaped form
      - new methods for URI::URL::_generic are:
           epath
           eparams
           equery
	   path_components
           absolute_path

    contain newline.

 o  HTTP::Status constants use empty prototype.

 o  Font metrics moved to a new subdirectory (lib/Font/Metrics)

 o  Don't use the VERSION script any more (even if it was very clever)

 o  HTML::Entities will now export the names decode_entities() and
    encode_entities().

 o  Andreas Koenig's black patch to HTML::Element.

    It also inserts a <BASE> tag in directories instead of a redirect.

 o  MIME::Base64 routines can be called as MIME::Base64::encode() and
    MIME::Base64::decode().  Same kind of thing for QuotedPrint.



Mon Nov  6 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Release 5b6

 o  Installation should work better for those that still runs
    perl4 as 'perl'.  The mirror script is not installed by
    default.

 o  LWP::Socket::_getaddress() Numerical IP adresses did not work.

 o  LWP::Socket::pushback() did not work.  This also avoids the bad
    pp_select() core dump from perl.

 o  LWP::IO now also selects on socket exceptions.

 o  HTML::Parse:  Ignore <!DOCTYPE ...> regardless for case.  Some
    bad insertElement() calls made infinite loops.

 o  The uri.t test works better for places where /tmp is a sym-link.



Sat Sep 16 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Release 5b5

 o  newlocal URI::URL does not put "//localhost" into the URLs any

    where the trailing slash is missing.



Thu Sep 14 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

    understands some more depreciated tags (like <xmp> and <listing>).

 o  HTML::Elements are now stingified using perl overloading.
    The interface to the traverse() callback has changed.

 o  Implemented HTML formatters for plain text and Postscript.

 o  Added lib/Font stuff to support the Postscript formatter.

Thu Sep  7 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Changed package name to libwww-perl-5xx

 o  Made LWP::Protocol::ftp actually transfer data

 o  Implemented methods for LWP::Socket to act as a server:
    bind(), listen(), accept(), getsockname(), host(), port()

 o  Release 0.04

 o  Implemented modules to parse HTML.



Mon Sep  4 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Implemented Mail::Cap which will become part of the MailTools
    package.

 o  Moved Base64 to MIME::Base64.  Reimplemented MIME::Base64 by using
    [un]pack("u",...)   Implemented LWP::MIME::QuotedPrint for
    completness sake.  Routine names has changed as suggested by Tim
    Bunce.

 o  LWP::MediaType reads default types from media.types file.
    guessMediaType() now also returns encodings.  New function mediaSuffix()

 o  Pass $url to $ua->getBasicCredentials().  This also fixes security
    hole with the old implementation of getBasicCredentials().

 o  LWP::Protocol::file now sets Content-Encoding headers

 o  Allow request content to be provided by a callback routine.

 o  Fix bug that prevented response callback to work.  The first parameter
    (data) is no longer a reference, because $_[0] is already a reference.
    Don't callback unless successful response.  Callbacks during redirects
    was confusing.

 o  URI::URL.  Remove port from netloc if it is the default port.
    Don't use anything, just require.

 o  HTTP::Message->addContent() does not need a reference parameter.

 o  LWP::Socket->open() has been renamed top LWP::Socket->connect()
    LWP::Socket->close has gone.  Implemented new method LWP::Socket->read()
    that returns as fast as it has some data to offer.  Implemented
    LWP::Socket->pushback().

 o  Does not die in LWP::UserAgent->request()

 o  LWP::Socket now use LWP::IO for low level IO

    escaping) that provide the uri_escape() and uri_unescape()
    functions.

 o  Setting $url->scheme now changes the class of the object.

 o  Made $httpurl->user() and $httpurl->password() illegal.
    Likewise for other URL schemes.




Wed Aug  9 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Reorganisation as discussed on <libwww-perl@ics.uci.edu>
       LWP::Date       --> HTTP::Date
       LWP::MIMEheader --> HTTP::Headers
       LWP::StatusCode --> HTTP::Status
       LWP::Message    --> HTTP::Message
       LWP::Request    --> HTTP::Request
       LWP::Response   --> HTTP::Response
       LWP::MIMEtypes  --> LWP::MediaTypes

 o  HTTP::Date parses ctime format with missing timezone as suggested
    by Roy Fielding <fielding@beach.w3.org>

 o  HTTP::Status and LWP::MediaTypes exports their functions by default.

 o  Splitted up the URI::URL module.  Schemes are implemented by separate
    files that are autoloaded when used.  Self test moved to "t/uri.t".


       
Mon Aug  7 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Applied patch from Marc Hedlund <hedlund@best.com>
       - Update the @header_order according to the August 3rd draft.
       - Added Response Header fields: 'Location', 'Public', 'Retry-After',
         'Server', and 'WWW-Authenticate'.
       - Moved 'unknown header' handling from &scan to &header. The old
         implementation was forcing all unknown header-words to begin with
	 an uppercase (as it should be), but disallowed other uppercase
	 letters.
       - updates the status code messages under the August
         3rd HTTP/1.0 draft.  '203' became 'Non-Authoritative Information',
	 '303' became 'See Other', and a new code,
	 '411 Authorization Refused', was added.

 o  Can remove multiple headers with single removeHeader() call in MIMEheader.

 o  Can assign multiple field/value pairs in header() method of MIMEheader.

 o  A field with multiple values is printed as separate values in
    MIMEheader::as_string().

 o  LWP::Response contain new attributes: previous() and request().  These
    attributes are updated by the UserAgent.

 o  Appended \n to some die statements in Socket so that line numbers are
    suppressed in error messages.

 o  Made UserAgent::clone work for reference members

 o  Check for redirect loops and multiple authorization failures by
    examination of the response chain.

 o  Use "\015\012" instead of "\r\n" in protocol modules.  Some systems
    define \r and \n differently.

 o  request program can now handle documents that needs autorization by
    prompting the user for username/password. Added new -S option to print
    request/response chain.

       - "test" has been renamed as "t"
       - test programs in "t" has been made Test::Harness compatible

    methods.  Reimplemented asString.  Removed asMIME().  Moved "Good
    Practice" into this file, and reimplemented it.

 o  Moved "header" and "content" into LWP::Message class.  This change made
    LWP::Request and LWP::Response much simpler.  Made clone() method
