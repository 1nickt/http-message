This code has not been released yet, but here's a change log detailing
changes as I make them. This will be tidied up in future once the first
alpha release has been made.


Wed Jun 14 1995

Removed lot of rendundant & before function calls.

$this --> $self

&collector passes content as a reference, don't want to copy so much

parameterlist to collect callback has been rearranged

Response::addContent gets a reference to the data

Added some callback documentation to UserAgent.pm

Protocol::file now uses the collector


Sun Jun 11 1995

Added basic authentication support

Added mirroring of single documents

Change Protocol construction from
whacky URL.pm (constructor returns
subclass) to more normal C++'ish way.


Wed June 7 ??? 1995

Minor cleanups from printed code inspection


Wed May 24 ??? 1995

Added redirection resolution
Added optional autoloading of protocols


Tue May 23 ??? 1995

Separated socket stuff into separate module
Added HTTP proxy support
Made alarm handling optional

Added a LWP::Message or completeness sake
Added LWP::MemberMixin to reduce code duplication

Cosmetic changes to LWP::Date
Renamed LWP::Error to LWP::StatusCode
Renamed LWP::MIME to LWP::MIMEtype

Changed the tests to cope with all this

It's getting there...

Changed the socket reading to use sysread.
This will have to go into a module of its own.
