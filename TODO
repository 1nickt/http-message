This list contains items that we plan to implement in libwww-perl5.
The order of items does not reflect priority.


HTTP/1.1 features:
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked
   Connection: Keep-Alive
   Wait 5 sec before sending content in request
   Content-Range

HTTP::Headers convenience access functions

Make multiple simultaneous requests work.  Make the callback request
interface event driven.

Provide initial credentials so that we don't always have to get a
RC_UNAUTHORIZED response first.

Allow information callback from protocol modules so that the UI can
inform the user of what is going on.  A good start is to pass the $ua
reference on to the protocol->request().

The ftp module should format directory listings as HTML.

Cache previous ftp connections.

Support MOVE, DELETE method for ftp.

Make file://non-localhost invoke the ftp.pm module.

Use Mail::Send to implement LWP::Protocol::mailto.

Investigate the Net::SSL module and implement support for https.

Formatters should support tables.  The postscript formatter should
inline images.

Make HTML parser warnings optional.

The HTML::Parse module should make meta information (<HEAD>) easier
to access.  Parse HTML 3.0 markup.

The HTML::Element->asHTML() method should not introduce whitespace
where it was not present before.

The request -o processing should check for Content-Encoding as well as
Content-Type.

The request script should optionally consult Mail::Cap for handling of
media types.

The request script should use the callback interface so that it prints
data as it is received.

The mirror script should be able to work recursively.

Make handcoded autoloading work on systems where the directory
separator is not "/".

More autoloading.

Include more useful programs

Implement a fabulous graphical UA based on Tk !!!!  HotPerl :-)

More tests

Fix bugs, it here are any...
