This list contains items that we plan to implement in libwww-perl5.
The order of items does not reflect priority.


MDA security

LWP::RobotUA

Make multiple simultaneous requests work.

Implement a fabulous graphical UA based on Tk !!!!  HotPerl :-)

Make information callback from protocol modules so that the UI can
inform the user of what is going on.

Make file://non-localhost invoke the ftp.pm module.

Make it work on systems where the directory separator is not "/", for
instance with MacPerl.

Use Mail::Send to implement LWP::Protocol::mailto.

Formatters should support tables.  The postscript formatter should
manage to inline images.
