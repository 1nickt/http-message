<h1>Libwww-perl-5</h1>

<h2>HTTP style communication</h2>

The libwww-perl library is based on HTTP style communication.  This is
a quote from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Protocols/">HTTP
specification</a> document:

<blockquote>
<p>The HTTP protocol is based on a request/response paradigm. A client
establishes a connection with a server and sends a request to the
server in the form of a request method, URI, and protocol version,
followed by a MIME-like message containing request modifiers, client
information, and possible body content. The server responds with a
status line, including the message's protocol version and a success or
error code, followed by a MIME-like message containing server
information, entity metainformation, and possible body content.
</blockquote>

<p>What this means to libwww-perl is that communcation takes place by
creating and configuring a <em>request</em> object.  This object is
then passed to a server and we get a <em>response</em> object in
return that we can examine.  It is as simple as that!

<h3>Request object</h3>

The request object has the class name <em>HTTP::Request</em> in
libwww-perl.  The main features of objects of this class are:

<ul>

  <li> The <b>method</b> is a short string that tells what kind of
       request this is.  The most usual methods are <em>GET</em>,
       <em>POST</em> and <em>HEAD</em>.

  <li> The <b>url</b> is a string denoting the protocol, server and
       the name of the "document" we want to access.  The url might
       also encode various other parameters.

  <li> The <b>headers</b> contain additional information about the
       request and is also used to describe the content.  The headers
       is a set of keyword/value pairs.

  <li> The <b>content</b> is an arbitrary amount of binary data.

</ul>

  

<h3>Response object</h3>

The request object has the class name <em>HTTP::Response</em> in
libwww-perl.  The main features of objects of this class are:

<ul>
  <li> The <b>code</b> is a numerical value that encode the overall
       outcome of the request.

  <li> The <b>message</b> is a short (human readable) string that
       corresponds to the <em>code</em>.
       
  <li> The <b>headers</b> describe the content.

  <li> The <b>content</b> is an arbitrary amount of binary data.

</ul>

Since we don't want to handle the <em>code</em> directly in our
programs the response object have methods that can be used to query
the kind of code present:

<ul>

  <li> <b>isSuccess</b>
  <li> <b>isRedirect</b>
  <li> <b>isError</b>
  
</ul>
  


<h3>User Agent</h3>

How do we describe this one????

<p>The "thing" that pass the request to the server and return a response
object.  The user agent handles transparent redirect handling,
security and proxying.



<h2>The OO interface</h2>

<pre>
#!/local/bin/perl -w

require LWP;
$ua = new LWP::UserAgent;

$request = new HTTP::Request 'GET', 'http://www.sn.no/';
$request->header('Accept', 'text/html');

$response = $ua->request($request);

if ($response->isSuccess) {
   die "This is bad" if $response->header('Content-Type') ne 'text/html';
   print $response->content;
} else {
   die "Request failed: " . $response->code . " " . $response->message . "\n";
}
</pre>

<h2>A simple as possible</h2>

<pre>
#!/local/bin/perl -w
use LWP::Simple;
getprint $ARGV[0] || die "Usage: $0 &lt;url&gt;\n";
</pre>
