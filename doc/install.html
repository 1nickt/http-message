<title>Installation of libwww-perl-5</title>

<h1>How do you install libwww-perl-5?</h1>

<ol>

  <li> First you have to obtain a copy of the <em>libwww-perl-5</em>
       package. It is distributed as a gzipped tar file which you must
       unpack at some suitable location in your file system.
       The most recent version of the library should be available at &lt;URL:<a
       href="http://www.sn.no/libwww-perl/">http://www.sn.no/libwww-perl/</a>&gt;
       as well as on the <a
       href="http://www.perl.com/perl/CPAN/CPAN.html">CPAN</a>.

  <li> Read the <em>README</em> file that comes with the package. It
       should mention what version of perl that is required.

  <li> Check perl version. Try to run the command <em>"perl -v"</em>. It should
       print a message like this <em>"This is perl, version
       5.002"</em>. If it prints <em>"perl: command not found"</em> then you
       need to install perl before you can proceed :-)

  <li> Run the following commands (the '$' is the shell prompt and might
       be different on your system and the <em>xx</em> will depend on
       the version of the library that you are installing):
<pre>
       $ cd libwww-perl-5.xx
       $ perl Makefile.PL
       $ make
       $ make test
       $ make install
</pre>

  <li> If it looks like these steps succeeded then that's it!
       
</ol>
